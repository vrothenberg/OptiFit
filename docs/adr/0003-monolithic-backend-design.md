# ADR 0003: Adopt a Monolithic Backend Design with Modular Services on a Single GCP VM Instance

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI requires a robust backend to handle various services such as authentication, data processing, AI integrations, and notifications. Initially, the project is in the design stage, and resource allocation needs to be optimized. The team must choose a backend architecture that balances simplicity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a **monolithic backend architecture** using a **single Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Machine (VM) instance**. The monolithic design will be modularized internally, allowing services to be spun out into separate Docker containers as the application scales.

### Reasons for Choosing a Monolithic Architecture Initially:
- **Simplicity:** Easier to develop, deploy, and manage in the early stages of the project.
- **Cost-Effective:** Lower initial infrastructure costs compared to managing multiple microservices.
- **Ease of Development:** Simplifies coordination and communication among development teams, reducing complexity.
- **Faster Deployment:** Enables quicker deployment cycles without the overhead of managing inter-service communication.
- **Modularity:** Internal modularization allows for components to be decoupled and later migrated to microservices as needed.

### Path to Microservices:
- **Docker Containerization:** Each modular service will be containerized using Docker, facilitating easy migration to microservices.
- **Scalability:** As user base and application complexity grow, individual services can be scaled independently by deploying them on separate VM instances or orchestrating them with Kubernetes (GKE).
- **Maintainability:** Modular design ensures that individual components can be updated, maintained, or replaced without affecting the entire system.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Microservices Architecture from the Start:**
  - **Pros:** Independent scalability, fault isolation, and flexibility in technology stacks.
  - **Cons:** Increased complexity in development, deployment, and management; higher initial infrastructure costs.
  
- **Serverless Architecture:**
  - **Pros:** Automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead.
  - **Cons:** Potential cold start issues, limited control over the execution environment, and vendor lock-in.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Simplified development and deployment processes during the initial phase.
  - Lower infrastructure costs and reduced operational overhead.
  - Flexibility to transition to a microservices architecture as the application scales.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Potential challenges in transitioning to microservices if the monolithic architecture becomes too tightly coupled.
  - Limited scalability for individual components compared to a fully decoupled microservices approach.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks to determine the optimal time for transitioning to microservices.
  - Ensure that modular design principles are strictly followed to facilitate seamless migration.
  - Plan for the adoption of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes (GKE) to manage microservices efficiently.
