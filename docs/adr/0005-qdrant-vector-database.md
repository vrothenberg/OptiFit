# ADR 0005: Implement QDrant as the Vector Database for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI plans to incorporate advanced AI features, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to enhance the AI Assistant’s ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. RAG relies on efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings to facilitate quick and relevant data access.

## Decision
We have decided to use **QDrant** as the vector database for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in OptiFit AI.

### Reasons for Choosing QDrant:
- **Specialized for Vector Data:** QDrant is specifically designed for storing and querying vector embeddings, making it ideal for RAG applications.
- **High Performance:** Offers fast similarity search and efficient indexing, ensuring quick retrieval of relevant data even with large datasets.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling growing volumes of vector data, supporting the scalability needs of OptiFit AI.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Provides easy integration with existing backend services and AI models, facilitating seamless data flow and interaction.
- **Open Source and Extensible:** QDrant is open-source, allowing customization and extension to meet specific project requirements.
- **Built-In Filtering:** Supports advanced filtering and metadata management, enabling more refined and context-aware data retrieval.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Pinecone:**
  - **Pros:** Managed service, easy to integrate, highly scalable.
  - **Cons:** Higher costs compared to open-source solutions, less control over infrastructure.
  
- **Weaviate:**
  - **Pros:** Combines vector search with graph capabilities, rich feature set.
  - **Cons:** More complex setup, potentially higher resource requirements.
  
- **Faiss:**
  - **Pros:** Highly efficient for similarity search, open-source.
  - **Cons:** Requires more manual setup and maintenance, lacks built-in metadata management.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Enhanced ability to perform efficient and accurate similarity searches, improving the AI Assistant’s response quality.
  - Scalability to handle increasing volumes of vector data as the app grows.
  - Cost-effective solution by leveraging an open-source vector database.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Requires additional setup and maintenance compared to fully managed services.
  - Potential learning curve for team members unfamiliar with QDrant.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Continuously monitor and optimize QDrant’s performance to ensure it meets the app’s evolving needs.
  - Explore advanced QDrant features, such as distributed deployments, to further enhance scalability and reliability.
  - Plan for potential integrations with other AI tools and databases to expand the app’s capabilities.
