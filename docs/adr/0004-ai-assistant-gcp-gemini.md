# ADR 0004: Utilize GCP and Gemini for AI Assistant

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI aims to provide an intelligent AI Assistant to offer personalized health and fitness recommendations, answer user queries, and facilitate interactive engagement. The AI Assistant needs to leverage powerful natural language processing (NLP) capabilities and integrate seamlessly with existing backend services.

## Decision
We have decided to implement the **AI Assistant** using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **Gemini**, leveraging our existing GCP billing account.

### Reasons for Choosing GCP and Gemini:
- **Existing GCP Billing Account:** Utilizing existing infrastructure and billing arrangements simplifies cost management and integration.
- **Gemini AI Capabilities:** Gemini offers advanced NLP and AI functionalities that align with our requirements for intelligent, context-aware interactions.
- **Seamless Integration:** GCP services integrate smoothly with our backend architecture, facilitating data flow and service orchestration.
- **Scalability:** GCP provides scalable resources to handle varying loads, ensuring the AI Assistant remains responsive as user base grows.
- **Security and Compliance:** GCP adheres to stringent security standards and compliance requirements, ensuring user data is protected.

### Key AI Assistant Features:
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Ability to comprehend and respond to user queries effectively.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailor health and fitness advice based on user data and preferences.
- **Conversational Interface:** Provide a user-friendly chat interface for seamless interactions.
- **Proactive Suggestions:** Offer timely tips and insights based on user behavior and data patterns.
- **Integration with Other Services:** Access and utilize data from food logging, sleep tracking, and exercise modules to enhance recommendations.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **OpenAI GPT-4:**
  - **Pros:** Highly advanced NLP capabilities, large community support.
  - **Cons:** Additional costs, reliance on external API beyond GCP ecosystem.
  
- **Amazon Lex:**
  - **Pros:** Deep integration with AWS services, scalable.
  - **Cons:** Requires integration with AWS, separate from GCP ecosystem.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - High-quality AI-driven interactions leveraging Geminiâ€™s advanced NLP capabilities.
  - Cost-effective implementation by utilizing existing GCP infrastructure and billing.
  - Seamless integration with the backend and other GCP services, enhancing overall system cohesion.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Dependency on Gemini and GCP for AI functionalities, which may introduce vendor lock-in.
  - Potential limitations in AI customization compared to building proprietary models.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Explore additional AI functionalities and integrations as the app scales.
  - Continuously monitor and optimize AI performance based on user feedback and usage patterns.
  - Evaluate alternative AI solutions for diversification and potential enhancements.
