# ADR 0007: Choose MongoDB or TimeScaleDB for Time-Series Data Storage

## Status
Pending

## Context
OptiFit AI needs to store and analyze large volumes of time-series data generated from user activities, such as food intake, sleep patterns, exercise routines, and circadian rhythms. Efficient storage and retrieval of this data are crucial for providing real-time insights and personalized recommendations.

## Decision
After evaluating the options, we have decided to use **TimeScaleDB** for storing time-series data in OptiFit AI.

### Reasons for Choosing TimeScaleDB:
- **Optimized for Time-Series Data:** TimeScaleDB is specifically designed for handling time-series data, offering efficient storage, querying, and analysis capabilities.
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility:** Built on top of PostgreSQL, allowing the use of familiar SQL queries and leveraging existing PostgreSQL features.
- **Scalability:** Handles large datasets and high ingestion rates, ensuring performance remains optimal as the user base grows.
- **Advanced Analytical Functions:** Provides powerful analytical tools, such as continuous aggregates and data retention policies, facilitating complex data analysis and reporting.
- **Ease of Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with our existing PostgreSQL setup on GCP, simplifying the overall architecture.

### Reasons Against Choosing MongoDB:
- **General-Purpose Database:** While MongoDB is a versatile NoSQL database, it is not specifically optimized for time-series data, which may lead to inefficiencies in storage and querying.
- **Complexity in Time-Series Handling:** Implementing time-series data handling in MongoDB requires additional configurations and optimizations, increasing development complexity.
- **Performance Limitations:** May not perform as well as TimeScaleDB for high-frequency time-series data ingestion and querying.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Optimized performance for time-series data storage and retrieval.
  - Enhanced analytical capabilities tailored for time-series data, enabling more insightful user recommendations.
  - Seamless integration with existing PostgreSQL backend, reducing architectural complexity.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TimeScaleDB.
  - Potential limitations if future requirements extend beyond time-series data functionalities.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Monitor database performance and scalability as data volume increases.
  - Explore additional TimeScaleDB features, such as compression and advanced analytics, to further enhance data handling.
  - Plan for potential database migrations or integrations if new data storage requirements emerge.
