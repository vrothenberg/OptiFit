# ADR 0008: Geolocation Services

## Status
Pending

## Context
OptiFit AI aims to offer personalized health and fitness recommendations that consider the user's environment. Geolocation services can enhance user experience by providing location-based insights, such as recommending nearby fitness centers, tracking outdoor activities, and tailoring nutrition suggestions based on regional food availability.

## Decision
We have decided to implement **Geolocation Services** using **Google Maps Platform** integrated with the backend on GCP.

### Reasons for Choosing Google Maps Platform:
- **Comprehensive APIs:** Provides a wide range of geolocation APIs, including Maps, Places, and Geocoding, facilitating various location-based functionalities.
- **Reliability and Scalability:** Backed by Google’s robust infrastructure, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **Integration with GCP:** Seamless integration with other GCP services, simplifying the overall architecture and data flow.
- **Extensive Documentation and Support:** Well-documented APIs and strong community support, aiding in development and troubleshooting.
- **Security and Compliance:** Adheres to industry-standard security practices and compliance requirements, ensuring user data protection.

### Key Geolocation Features:
- **Activity Tracking:** Monitor and log outdoor activities such as running, cycling, and hiking with precise location data.
- **Nearby Facilities:** Recommend nearby gyms, parks, and fitness centers based on user location.
- **Regional Nutrition Insights:** Provide nutrition suggestions and meal plans tailored to regional food availability and preferences.
- **Weather Integration:** Incorporate weather data to offer dynamic workout recommendations and plan outdoor activities accordingly.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **OpenStreetMap with OpenCage Geocoder:**
  - **Pros:** Open-source, lower costs.
  - **Cons:** Limited features compared to Google Maps Platform, less comprehensive data coverage.
  
- **Mapbox:**
  - **Pros:** Highly customizable maps, strong developer tools.
  - **Cons:** Higher costs for extensive usage, less seamless integration with GCP.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Enhanced user experience through location-based personalization and recommendations.
  - Access to a rich set of geolocation features that can be expanded as the app evolves.
  - Reliable and scalable geolocation services backed by Google’s infrastructure.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Increased dependency on third-party services, which may introduce costs and potential service limitations.
  - Potential privacy concerns related to handling user location data, necessitating robust privacy policies and user consent mechanisms.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Implement user consent and privacy controls to manage location data responsibly.
  - Explore additional geolocation features, such as location-based notifications and event recommendations.
  - Monitor usage costs and optimize API calls to manage expenses effectively.
