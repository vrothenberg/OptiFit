# ADR 0009: Use Redis for Caching Recently Accessed Data

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI needs to ensure quick data retrieval and reduce latency for frequently accessed information, such as user profiles, recent activities, and AI-generated recommendations. Implementing an efficient caching mechanism is essential to enhance performance and provide a seamless user experience.

## Decision
We have decided to implement **Redis** as the caching solution to store recently accessed data in OptiFit AI.

### Reasons for Choosing Redis:
- **High Performance:** Redis operates in-memory, providing extremely fast read and write operations, which significantly reduces data retrieval times.
- **Versatile Data Structures:** Supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, allowing flexible caching strategies.
- **Scalability:** Can be easily scaled horizontally using Redis Cluster, ensuring it can handle increasing loads as the user base grows.
- **Persistence Options:** Offers configurable persistence options (RDB snapshots and AOF logs) to ensure data durability and recovery in case of failures.
- **Extensive Features:** Includes features like pub/sub messaging, transactions, and Lua scripting, providing additional functionalities beyond simple caching.
- **Broad Language Support:** Provides client libraries for multiple programming languages, facilitating easy integration with our backend services.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Memcached:**
  - **Pros:** Simple, high-performance caching solution.
  - **Cons:** Limited data structure support compared to Redis, no built-in persistence.
  
- **Elasticache (Managed Redis Service):**
  - **Pros:** Managed service, easy scalability, integrates well with AWS.
  - **Cons:** Opting for self-managed Redis on GCP to maintain consistency with our current cloud provider and infrastructure.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Significant reduction in data retrieval latency for frequently accessed information.
  - Enhanced scalability and performance, ensuring a smooth user experience even under high load.
  - Flexibility in caching strategies due to Redisâ€™s versatile data structures.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Additional operational overhead for managing and maintaining the Redis instance.
  - Potential costs associated with in-memory data storage, especially as the cache size grows.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Implement caching strategies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) to optimize memory usage.
  - Monitor cache hit rates and adjust caching policies to maximize performance benefits.
  - Explore Redis Sentinel for high availability and Redis Cluster for horizontal scalability as needed.
