# ADR 0002: Use Flutter as Frontend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI aims to provide a seamless and responsive user experience across multiple platforms (iOS and Android). The frontend framework needs to support rapid development, high performance, and a rich set of UI components. Additionally, the framework should facilitate easy maintenance and scalability as the app evolves.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Flutter** as the frontend framework for OptiFit AI.

### Reasons for Choosing Flutter:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Flutter allows for a single codebase to deploy on both iOS and Android, reducing development time and effort.
- **Rich UI Components:** Flutter offers a wide range of customizable widgets, enabling the creation of visually appealing and highly interactive user interfaces.
- **Performance:** Flutter compiles to native ARM code, ensuring high performance and smooth animations.
- **Hot Reload:** Facilitates rapid development and testing by allowing developers to see changes in real-time without restarting the app.
- **Strong Community and Support:** Flutter has a growing community and extensive documentation, providing ample resources for troubleshooting and feature implementation.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Easily integrates with existing backend services and third-party APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and functionality.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **React Native:**
  - **Pros:** Mature ecosystem, large community, reusable components.
  - **Cons:** Performance may lag behind Flutter, especially for complex animations; relies on JavaScript, which can introduce runtime errors.
  
- **Native Development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android):**
  - **Pros:** Best performance, full access to platform-specific features.
  - **Cons:** Requires maintaining separate codebases for iOS and Android, increasing development time and costs.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Reduced development time and cost due to a single codebase for multiple platforms.
  - Enhanced ability to deliver a consistent and high-quality user experience across devices.
  - Faster iteration and feature deployment with Flutter’s hot reload feature.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Dart, Flutter’s programming language.
  - Potential limitations in accessing certain platform-specific features, although Flutter's plugin ecosystem mitigates this.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Monitor Flutter’s updates and ecosystem growth to leverage new features and optimizations.
  - Invest in training for developers to maximize Flutter’s capabilities and maintain code quality.
