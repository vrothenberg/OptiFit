# ADR 0006: Implement Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OptiFit AI requires a reliable and scalable solution to deliver push notifications and reminders to users. Notifications will play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement, reminding users to log their activities, providing motivational messages, and delivering personalized health tips.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for implementing push notifications and reminders in OptiFit AI.

### Reasons for Choosing Firebase Cloud Messaging:
- **Free Tier Availability:** FCM offers a generous free tier, making it cost-effective for initial deployment and scaling.
- **Seamless Integration with Firebase:** Easily integrates with other Firebase services, such as Authentication and Analytics, streamlining the overall backend architecture.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Supports both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring consistent notification delivery across devices.
- **Rich Features:** Provides features like topic-based messaging, user segmentation, and scheduling, enabling targeted and timely notifications.
- **Reliability and Scalability:** Backed by Google’s infrastructure, ensuring high reliability and the ability to handle large volumes of messages.
- **Ease of Use:** Comprehensive documentation and SDKs simplify the implementation process for developers.

### Key Notification Features:
- **Reminders:** Notify users to log their food, sleep, and exercise data at predefined times.
- **Motivational Messages:** Send motivational quotes and encouragement to keep users engaged with their health goals.
- **Personalized Tips:** Deliver tailored health and fitness tips based on user data and activity patterns.
- **Achievement Alerts:** Inform users about milestones and achievements to reinforce positive behaviors.
- **Circadian Optimization Tips:** Provide tips aligned with users’ circadian rhythms to enhance health outcomes.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **OneSignal:**
  - **Pros:** Feature-rich, easy setup, supports multiple platforms.
  - **Cons:** Limited features on the free tier, potential costs as usage scales.
  
- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):**
  - **Pros:** Highly scalable, integrates well with AWS ecosystem.
  - **Cons:** Requires AWS integration, potentially higher costs compared to FCM.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Cost-effective solution with a robust free tier to support initial user base.
  - Easy integration with existing Firebase and GCP services, simplifying development.
  - Reliable and scalable notification delivery ensuring timely and consistent user engagement.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Dependence on Firebase and Google’s ecosystem may introduce vendor lock-in.
  - Limited customization options compared to building a proprietary notification system.
  
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Monitor notification performance and user engagement metrics to optimize messaging strategies.
  - Explore advanced FCM features like rich notifications and in-app messaging for enhanced user experience.
  - Evaluate the need for migrating to alternative services if FCM limitations arise as the app scales.
