# ADR 0001: Use Django as Backend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a backend framework for OptiFit AI that supports rapid development, scalability, security, and integration with AI/ML libraries. The framework should also have a strong community and comprehensive documentation.

## Decision
We have decided to use **Django** with **Django REST Framework (DRF)** as our backend framework.

### Reasons for Choosing Django:
- **Rapid Development:** Django's "batteries-included" philosophy provides built-in features like ORM, authentication, and admin interface, speeding up development.
- **Security:** Django offers robust security features out-of-the-box, protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Scalability:** Django's modular architecture allows for scalable applications, and recent versions support asynchronous views to handle high concurrency.
- **Python Ecosystem:** Django's integration with Python facilitates the use of AI/ML libraries, essential for OptiFit AI's AI-driven features.
- **Community and Documentation:** Django has a large and active community, along with extensive documentation and reusable packages.

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Node.js with Express:**
  - **Pros:** Non-blocking architecture, suitable for real-time features.
  - **Cons:** Requires more effort to set up features that Django provides out-of-the-box, less integrated with Python-based AI/ML libraries.
  
- **FastAPI:**
  - **Pros:** High performance, asynchronous capabilities, modern design.
  - **Cons:** Smaller community compared to Django, fewer built-in features.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Faster development due to built-in features.
  - Enhanced security and data integrity.
  - Seamless integration with Python's AI/ML ecosystem.
  
- **Negative:**
  - Potential performance limitations compared to asynchronous frameworks for extremely high-concurrency scenarios, although mitigated with Django's asynchronous capabilities.
  - Less flexibility in framework structure compared to more minimalist frameworks like Express.
