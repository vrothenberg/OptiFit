# Deployment Plan

A well-defined deployment plan ensures that OptiFit AI is launched smoothly, maintains high availability, and scales efficiently as the user base grows. This plan outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for deploying the app to production.

## **1. Deployment Objectives**
- **Seamless Deployment:** Ensure minimal downtime during deployment.
- **Scalability:** Architect the system to handle increasing user loads efficiently.
- **Security:** Maintain robust security measures during and after deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring to track app performance and detect issues early.

## **2. Deployment Phases**

### **2.1 Pre-Deployment**
- **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
- **Testing:** Ensure all testing phases (unit, integration, system, UAT) are completed and passed.
- **Documentation:** Update all documentation, including API docs, deployment scripts, and user guides.
- **Backup:** Take backups of existing databases and configurations to prevent data loss.

### **2.2 Deployment Infrastructure**

#### **Cloud Provider:**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Selected for its robust infrastructure, scalability, and integration with other GCP services.

#### **Compute Services:**
- **Google Compute Engine (GCE):** Initially, deploy Docker containers on GCE VM instances using Docker Compose.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Plan for future migration to GKE for advanced container orchestration, scalability, and management.

#### **Storage Services:**
- **Google Cloud Storage:** Store user-uploaded images and other static assets.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL via Google Cloud SQL and Firestore for NoSQL needs.

#### **CI/CD Pipeline:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **GCP Cloud Build:** Integrated with GitHub Actions to handle building and deploying applications.

### **2.3 Deployment Steps**

#### **2.3.1 Containerization**
- **Dockerize Applications:**
  - Ensure both frontend (Flutter) and backend (Django) are containerized using Docker.
  - Create Dockerfiles for each service, specifying the necessary dependencies and configurations.
  
- **Docker Compose Setup:**
  - Define services, networks, and volumes in a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multi-container deployments locally and on GCE.

#### **2.3.2 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Terraform Scripts:**
  - Develop Terraform scripts to provision GCP resources, ensuring infrastructure consistency and version control.
  - Define modules for common components like VM instances, storage buckets, and databases.

#### **2.3.3 CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
- **GitHub Actions Workflows:**
  - **Build Workflow:**
    - Triggered on code commits or pull requests.
    - Build Docker images for frontend and backend services.
    - Run automated tests to ensure code integrity.
  
  - **Deploy Workflow:**
    - Triggered upon successful build and test phases.
    - Push Docker images to Google Container Registry (GCR).
    - Deploy containers to GCE using Docker Compose.
  
- **GCP Cloud Build Integration:**
  - Use Cloud Build for advanced build processes, such as multi-stage builds or integrating with GKE for future scalability.

#### **2.3.4 Security Measures**
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Use Google Secret Manager to securely store and access API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
  
- **Firewall Rules:**
  - Configure firewall rules to allow necessary traffic (e.g., ports 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) while restricting unauthorized access.

- **SSL Certificates:**
  - Obtain SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt or GCP's managed SSL services to secure data in transit.

#### **2.3.5 Monitoring and Logging Setup**
- **Google Cloud Monitoring:**
  - Set up dashboards to monitor system performance, resource utilization, and application health.
  
- **Google Cloud Logging:**
  - Centralize logs from all services for easy access and troubleshooting.
  
- **Sentry Integration:**
  - Integrate Sentry for real-time error tracking and alerting, enabling quick resolution of issues.

### **2.4 Post-Deployment**
- **Smoke Testing:** Perform basic tests to ensure that the deployment was successful and that critical functionalities are operational.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor app performance and user activity using Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging.
- **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback to identify and address any post-launch issues or improvement areas.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly update the app with patches, new features, and performance optimizations based on user feedback and monitoring insights.

## **3. Rollback Strategy**
- **Backup Restoration:** In case of deployment failures, restore databases from the latest backups.
- **Previous Docker Images:** Revert to previous stable Docker images to minimize downtime.
- **Infrastructure Rollback:** Use Terraform to roll back to the previous infrastructure state if necessary.
- **Communication:** Inform users promptly about any issues and provide estimated resolution times.

## **4. Scalability Considerations**
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design services to scale horizontally by adding more container instances as the user base grows.
- **Auto-Scaling with GKE:** Utilize GKE's auto-scaling capabilities to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
- **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and performance.

## **5. Continuous Improvement**
- **Regular Updates:** Schedule regular updates to introduce new features, improvements, and security patches.
- **Performance Optimization:** Continuously analyze performance metrics and optimize the app for faster load times and better resource utilization.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Incorporate user feedback into the development cycle to enhance app functionalities and user satisfaction.
