  - **API Testing:** Postman or Insomnia for testing RESTful APIs.
- **Responsibilities:** QA engineers collaborate with developers to design integration tests covering critical workflows.

### **2.3 System Testing**
- **Purpose:** Test the complete and integrated application to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.
- **Tools:**
  - **Automation:** Selenium for end-to-end testing.
  - **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing by QA teams.
- **Responsibilities:** QA teams perform comprehensive testing to identify issues before deployment.

### **2.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
- **Purpose:** Validate the app’s functionalities and user experience from the end-user’s perspective.
- **Tools:**
  - **Feedback Tools:** In-app feedback forms, surveys.
  - **Beta Testing Platforms:** TestFlight for iOS, Google Play Beta for Android.
- **Responsibilities:** Engage a group of beta testers to use the app in real-world scenarios and provide feedback.

### **2.5 Security Testing**
- **Purpose:** Identify and address security vulnerabilities to protect user data and ensure compliance.
- **Tools:**
  - **Vulnerability Scanners:** OWASP ZAP, Nessus.
  - **Penetration Testing:** Third-party security firms.
- **Responsibilities:** Security teams conduct regular scans and penetration tests, addressing any identified vulnerabilities promptly.

### **2.6 Performance Testing**
- **Purpose:** Ensure the app performs efficiently under various conditions, including high user loads.
- **Tools:**
  - **Load Testing:** JMeter, Locust.
  - **Monitoring:** Google Cloud Monitoring for real-time performance metrics.
- **Responsibilities:** Performance engineers design and execute tests to simulate different load scenarios, optimizing the app based on results.

## **3. Testing Processes**

### **3.1 Test Planning**
- **Define Scope:** Identify the features and functionalities to be tested.
- **Resource Allocation:** Assign responsibilities to team members.
- **Schedule:** Create a timeline for testing activities aligned with the development phases.

### **3.2 Test Design**
- **Test Cases:** Develop detailed test cases for each testing type, covering positive and negative scenarios.
- **Test Data:** Prepare realistic and diverse test data to simulate various user interactions and data inputs.

### **3.3 Test Execution**
- **Automated Testing:** Run automated tests during the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure continuous validation.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual tests for exploratory scenarios and user experience evaluations.

### **3.4 Defect Management**
- **Logging:** Use tools like Jira to log identified defects with detailed descriptions and reproduction steps.
- **Prioritization:** Categorize defects based on severity and impact on the user experience.
- **Resolution:** Assign defects to developers for timely fixes and verify resolutions through re-testing.

### **3.5 Continuous Improvement**
- **Feedback Loops:** Incorporate feedback from UAT and beta testing into the development cycle for iterative improvements.
- **Retrospectives:** Conduct post-testing phase reviews to identify lessons learned and optimize testing processes.
